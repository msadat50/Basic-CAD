## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base. in the beginning i had some struggling but i figure it out
### Evidence
[The Base in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/0d70f655203ca304cb3c5b7d/w/f55603f962f6fc74f5548a68/e/41d730c570a8d75fce9f51b6)
### Image
This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The second assignment was the Mount i had trouble making the holes but Mr. H's help me out.

### Evidence
![The Mount in onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/aa606e756544aee723402628/w/3e0727ce1a2b8dadfbf56f4f/e/009e27c6cc3142c2b949009c)

### Reflection
This was the second assignment it was eazy but i had some trouble making the holes on Linear pattern, when i was doing the holes it was going to the left it supposed to go to the right.and than i join the officer house. me and Mr.H look through the problem and he said look at the arrow he said that the arrow was down and when i flip the arrow  up then the holes was where it support to be.

* I learn how to make holes
* I learn how to cut and extrude

### Reflection
This assignment was eazy but it was a bit confusing at the end, i had trouble making the configuration i didn't know how to make a configurtion on the other part studio in onshape. i watch the video again and i saw that Mr.Dierolf changes the color of dowel pin, and that's how you can make configuration table by changing the color.
following along with Mr. Dierolf made it super easy
I learn about
* I learn how to make a Configurations

### Reflection
This assignment was really confusing we were tryping to copy the configuration and paste it on the other part Studio in onshape, when we did it it didn't work.and my sketch wasn't fully defined so we add it some dimension to it but me and Mr. H's figure it out and we finshed it
following along with Mr. Dierolf made it easy but the last part was so confusing  because he didn't show how he did this sketch and we had troubleing doing the last part
I leaned about
* I learn how to assemble all the parts
* I learn how to generator dowel pin in different sizes
* I learn that i should check things before doing them
